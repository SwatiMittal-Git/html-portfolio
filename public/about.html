<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey everyone!! </p>

<p>So my name is Swati Mittal. And I am currently pursuing my B.Tech degree from ABES Engineering College, Ghaziabad. My department is Computer Science and Engineering which is one of the most elite courses that everyone looks up there. I have just completed my 1st year so far and is now looking forward to give my best in the upcoming session. Throughout the 1st year I got to learn a lot about various skills including public speaking, designing, content writing, academic and technical skills as well. I am a part of E-Cell Community and Samvaad Club of my college.
  Being a part of E-cell Community fascinates me as it empowers my innovative mindset  and being a Samvaadian shows up how enthusiastic I am towards all the co-curricular activities including acting, dancing and singing. </p>

<p>The SGPA that I have maintained during my 1st semester sums up to *9.82* which surely is a milestone for me. The techinal skills that I have worked on during the last year includes C language, basics of C++ and a little bit of Frontend Development. I am planning to continue learning Full Stack Web Development this year. I have also learned a bit of content writing and have also participated in some debate competitions including 'FORTIFY' conducted by the Minerva Club of my college. Being one of the organiser of our hostel fest 'URJA', I got to learn about facing and solving various challenges that occurs while conducting an event.</p>

<p>While working on all these, I came to know that my biggest strength is my never giving up attitude and my willingness to take the initiative for any kind of work. I am blessed with parents that always supports me. My mentors as well as my friends also never backs up in supporting me. However, I stand up with a firm believe that Self-Confidence and Consistency are the key to any success.</p>

<p>So, concluding all these I am able to stumble on my various strengths and weaknesses at the end of the first year of my B.Tech journey and there is lots and lots of more yet to be discoverd. Taking resolution to bang on my weaknesses and sharpen my strengths this year.</p>
